# A Simple Weather App with Vanilla JavaScript

**Description:**

This is a Weather App built with Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and SCSS. This Javascript Project uses the Open Weather Map API to retrieve weather data and displays a mobile first responsive web design. This Vanilla JS app also features accessibility considerations, the geolocation API, persistent data storage, the Fetch API with Async / Await, and Serverless Functions. This is one of the projects done as the part of my web development learning process.

You can view the app here: https://srdev-js-weather-app.netlify.app/

I followed Dave Gray's tutorial to make this project.
